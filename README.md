## ðŸŒŸ My Story

Once upon a time, I was simply curious â€” curious about how machines think, how data reveals secrets, and how technology can shape the future.

ðŸŽ“ I began this journey at Queenâ€™s University Belfast, diving deep into Artificial Intelligence.  
It wasnâ€™t just about models or algorithms; it was about **teaching machines to think, feel, and collaborate**.

I spent days â€” and many nights â€” crafting:
- ðŸ§  Fine-tuned LLMs that could adapt to new tasks (BERT, Llama3, QLoRA)
- ðŸŽ¥ Vision Models like YOLOv8, SAHI, and SAM2 that could detect objects faster than the human eye
- ðŸ“š Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems that could *learn on the fly*  
- ðŸ’» BigQuery-powered analytics that handled millions of records effortlessly

Along the way, my passion grew â€”  
not just for AI engineering, but for **making data human**, **making intelligence accessible**, and **creating technologies that empower real lives**.
