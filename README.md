## 🌟 My Story

Once upon a time, I was simply curious, curious about how machines think, how data reveals secrets, and how technology can shape the future.

🎓 I began this journey at Queen’s University Belfast, diving deep into Artificial Intelligence.  
It wasn’t just about models or algorithms; it was about **teaching machines to think, feel, and collaborate**.

I spent days and many nights crafting:
- 🧠 Fine-tuned LLMs that could adapt to new tasks
- 🎥 Vision Models like YOLOv8, SAHI, and SAM2 that could detect objects faster than the human eye
- 📚 Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems that could *learn on the fly*  
- 💻 BigQuery-powered analytics that handled millions of records effortlessly

Along the way, my passion grew:
not just for AI engineering, but for **making data human**, **making intelligence accessible**, and **creating technologies that empower real lives**.

## 🚀 The Dreams I'm Building

- 🔥 **AutoStartup**: AI-driven crew that brainstorms startups autonomously.
- 🧠 **WikiBot**: A RAG-powered chatbot that reasons with real knowledge.
- 🎵 **EmoTune**: An audio-driven emotion recognition system.
- 🌸 **MenstroSync**:  
  My proudest FemTech project — AI-powered menstrual health management, mood tracking, and emotional support platform.
