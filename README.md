## 🌟 My Story

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: space-between;">

<div style="flex: 1;">

Ever since I can remember, I have been fascinated by how intelligence can be created, understood, and shared.  
Whether it's a neural network making decisions or a dataset revealing hidden patterns, I've always believed **technology is a language of empowerment**.

🎓 During my time at **Queen’s University Belfast**, I immersed myself in Artificial Intelligence, blending **deep learning, data engineering, and real-world innovation**.

But it was never just about models or metrics.
It was about **teaching machines to think, feel, and collaborate** just like humans do.

🔍 Along my journey:
- 🧠 Fine-tuned LLMs for adaptive intelligence.
- 🎥 Engineered computer vision models for smart detection.
- 📚 Built RAG pipelines enabling dynamic learning and reasoning.
- 🧹 Designed BigQuery data engineering systems managing **100M+ records**.
- ✍️ Published groundbreaking AI research with **Springer** and **IEEE**.

🌸 Founding **MenstroSync** became my proudest moment:
an AI-driven FemTech platform supporting menstrual health, emotional resilience, and smart cycle prediction.

🗣️ Outside of code, you’ll find me **delivering talks**, **mentoring emerging tech talent**, and **leading workshops** 
because **public speaking** lets me combine technology with storytelling, making complex ideas beautifully human.

Today, my purpose is simple:  
> **Make AI more human, make data more compassionate, and inspire change through innovation.**
